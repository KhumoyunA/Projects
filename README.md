Connect4 – a program that lets two users play a Connect 4 game. Players input a column number.
           Since the board consists of lists, the first column is chosen by inputting 0.

Number Guess – a program that generates a random number in a given range for a user to guess. The user is given 3 attempts to successfully guess the number.
               After each failed attempt, the program gives a clue to help the user.

Tic Tac Toe – a program that lets two users play a Tic Tac Toe game. Players choose signs they want to play with, a column, and a line. 
              The board is similar to that of Connect4, so the same rule for choosing a column and line applies.
