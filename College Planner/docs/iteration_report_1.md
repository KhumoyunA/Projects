## Issues & Adjustments
### Roadblocks:
- Issues when loading the application due to its dependency on the backend
- Navigating between the frontend and backend, the process of connecting them both and generating output took time
- Dependencies with the structure of the iteration
- Difficulty with conditionally formatting text
- Although a schema was present in the database, pycharm kept saying there is no table 'events'


### Adjustments to overall design:
- We will need to modify data types for our schema and frontend template
- Ordering of different attributes within the add query will need to be changed

### Things we did well :)
- Using discord to troubleshoot even if we couldn't work in the same room was helpful
- Discussing dependencies before beginning work
- Working together in the same room
