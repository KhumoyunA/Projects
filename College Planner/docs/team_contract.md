B. Team Procedures: 
1. Method for setting and following meeting agendas:

	Leaders should be responsible for leading meetings and making agendas. 

2. Method of record keeping: 

	Team members will enter what they worked on in a shared google document each time they work.

3. Procedures in the absence of a team member:

	Team members should join us on Discord if they are unable to attend meetings. If they cannot attend that way, they should let the rest of the team know on Discord. 

C. Team Participation: 
1. Strategies to ensure cooperation and equal distribution of tasks: 

	On Tuesday, each member is assigned a user story to work on. They are expected to complete it by Sunday night at 11:59. If the member is struggling or the story is difficult, they can ask other members for help. If a task is too big, we can adjust it during team meetings by assigning it to multiple members or breaking it down. 

2. Strategies for encouraging/including ideas from all team members (team maintenance): 

	All team members should be receptive and supportive of ideas. The team should vote on each idea if it should be implemented or not. 

3. Strategies for keeping on task (task maintenance):

	Sunday night deadlines, Discord if a member has a question, and meeting check-ins. 

D. Personal Accountability: 
1. Expected individual attendance, punctuality, and participation at all team meetings: 

	Absent members should schedule another meeting with the team leader and/or other members to make up for the absence. They can do this 2 times during the semester. 

2. Expected level of responsibility for fulfilling team assignments, timelines, and deadlines: 

	If a team member cannot complete a task by the deadline, they should let other members know on Discord. If someone cannot finish by the deadline and the team finds their explanation valid, they are excused.
	Team members are allowed 2 “grace tokens” during the project where they can finish their work past the deadline.

3. Expected level of communication with other team members: 

	Members should be active on the Discord server and participate in team meetings.

4. Consequence if team member does not comply to these rules

	If a group member doesn't complete their work for 2 weeks and stops attending meetings, then this would be grounds to inform Dr. Liffiton that the member is not participating in the assignment.
	Possible consequence at this point could be removing this member from the group plan until they start attending meetings again.

	Prior to these actions, the other group members will discuss whether these consequences are necessary.
