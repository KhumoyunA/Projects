### What we could not complete:
- Delete an event dynamically
- Edit event dynamically. It was implemented without using JS.

## Issues & Adjustments
### Roadblocks:
- Trying to implement JS for check, uncheck, delete an event, and edit an event
- Specifying the size of a textarea and making all input in a form have the same margins
- Rendering the main page for add and delete a to do
- Using Bootstrap's collapse feature in another template, which did not seem to work unless everything was in the same 
  template.

### Adjustments to overall design:
- Using Python + Jinja for check/uncheck instead of JS
- We found a way to implement add task as a drop down card with all the input fields
  Popup window that includes all information about a task when clicked. We will implement it this coming week.
- Dynamic deletion and edit using JS was given a lower priority and moved to a later week due to its complexity

### Things we did well :)
- Having impromptu meetings whenever possible to work in the same space
- Working with both back-end and front-end to implement templates 
- Writing unit tests to make sure all features are working as intended

### Things we learnt during the iteration
- Exactly how powerful Jinja can be (very!), what it can do, and how to do it. We specifically used conditionals 
  but we found a lot of other potentially useful things in the docs.
- A better understanding of how to change webpage style using bootstrap.
- Deeper understanding of Bootstrap components like Collapse and Modal.
