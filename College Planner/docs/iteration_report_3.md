### What was done this week:
- Back-end functions for Create Account and Login
- Add event using dropdown
- Filter by Data
- Sort by Time
- Schema Constraints
- Log In and Create Account templates
- Calendar Template

### What we could not complete:
- Login and logout functionality (i.e. connecting backend and frontend)
- Calendar view (functionality of using calendar template) and event repeat

## Issues & Adjustments
### Roadblocks:
- Difficulty with displaying log in and create account page functionality
- In order to retrieve data, we need to use GET instead of POST
- Importing calendar that is using CSS styling, as it do not work within the main_template
- It was difficult to connect log in and log out templates with a landing page, while modifying interconnection between other templates. 

### Adjustments to overall design:
- One of the adjustment we made to the overall design is that we decided to create a landing page that our users will see when they open our application. From this page, users can choose an option to either log in or create an account. However, we were not able to implement this this week, since log in feature is not functional. 
- Uncheck/Check status needs to be stored as string for unit testing
- Event repeat will need to modify schema

### Things we did well :)
- Manage and work around dependencies
- Communicate regarding roadblocks, errors, and progress outside of meeting time

### Things we learnt during the iteration
- The basics of werkzeug and hashing
- Interconnecting templates and their functionality
- Debug and readjust our functions and unit tests
